# matlab-gene-models

- A matlab function for obtaning the gene expression models expression for the model rules. it reads the file as readtable for faster rates as compared to the Readexcel. 
- Added a web interface to deploy matlab functions and building a mathematical model javascriptframe which will integrate all the mathematical models and mathematical gems.
- The matlab engine should be installed and your function should be ready see this [matlab proxy](https://github.com/mathworks/matlab-engine-for-python)
- A javscript framework i am writing from matlab to probabilistic tensors for machine learning. Let me know.
- **This code will be updated awaiting a reply from MATLAB as for the integration of the compiled or direct functions can be called.**
